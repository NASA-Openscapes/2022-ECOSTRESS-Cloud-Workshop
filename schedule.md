- JupyterHub: Log in. 
  - Log into 2i2c. This takes a few minutes so please start this as soon we reconvene each day.
- GitHub: Get the latest.
  - You may need to git fetch, merge, and pull: follow the github workflows  [daily setup](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/logistics/github-workflows.html#daily-setup).

#### Closing Day 2

- **Thank you!**
- **Continued hacking on the cloud - next 3 months**. You will continue to have access to the 2i2c JupyterHub in AWS for three months following the SWOT Ocean Cloud Workshop so you can continue to work and we all learn more about what is involved with migrating data access and science workflows to the Cloud. This cloud compute environment is supported by the [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/) project. 

## Getting help during the Workshop

We will use WebEx Chat as our main channels for help. Please use WebEx Chat to post questions, or request a breakout room.
